### Short Project Description

This website was developed as part of the course Mapping Cities – Making Cities by Prof. Dr. Marian Dörk at University of Applied Sciences Potsdam, Winter semester 2021/22. You can see course website and the results of the other teams [here](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/mapping/).

Our collaboration and data partner was [Maas L.A.B.S](http://maas4.de) at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam. The research collaboration conducted a study tracing the mobility of 32 participants in Northern Potsdam in March 2021. Not only did they record their GPS pathways. They also collected the mode of transportation and the reason for each, specific trip. That gave us a unique insight into a set of very privacy-sensitive yet highly interesting data points that possibly tell us more about how individual mobility works. We asked ourselves how we can create a meaningful, rich visualization of the data while still ensuring the participants' privacy - and came up with mobility networks.
